  ## Description
  Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. As user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant. The Book Search Engine project takes a fully functioning Google Books API search application originally built with a RESTful API and refactors it into a GraphQL-powered API using Apollo Server. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the app allows users to search for books and save favorites, with secure user authentication and database persistence.
